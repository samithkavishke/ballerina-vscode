# Workflows status

Ported from `wso2/vscode-extensions` and `ballerina-platform/ballerina-language-server`,
then pruned to a ballerina-only monorepo. Paths have been rewritten to the new layout
(`packages/ballerina-extension`, `submodules/wso2-vscode-extensions/workspaces/common-libs/`).

## Ballerina language server workflows

| File | Source | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `ls-publish-release.yml` | ballerina-language-server repo | manual release |

(The LS PR build, daily build and Trivy scan are merged into `pull-request.yml` and
`daily-build.yml`; there are no separate `ls-build-master.yml` / `ls-trivy.yml`
workflows in this repo.)

Each has `defaults.run.working-directory: packages/ballerina-language-server` injected so
`./gradlew …` steps resolve correctly from repo root.

## VSCode extension workflows

| File | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `build.yml` | `workflow_call` only | Reusable build pipeline (ballerina-only) |
| `daily-build.yml` | nightly cron + manual | Syncs the `nightly` branch, runs the LS multi-branch pack/test/Windows-build matrix **and** calls `build.yml` for the extension, publishes the rolling `nightly` GitHub pre-release, then dispatches success/failure notifications. See [Versioning](#versioning) and [The nightly branch](#the-nightly-branch) |
| `pull-request.yml` | PRs + manual | Detects changes with `dorny/paths-filter`; if anything build-relevant changed, runs `build.yml` which builds the entire chain (LS via Gradle, then all TS packages and the extension VSIX via rush) in a single job. Windows LS coverage runs in `daily-build.yml` only. |
| `release-vsix.yml` | manual dispatch | Builds, then for a real release creates the GitHub release, pushes `release/<version>` and opens the release PR into the `X.Y.x` line. For a pre-release the GitHub release is opt-in (`githubRelease`) and nothing is branched. See [Branches](#branches) |
| `publish-vsix.yml` | manual dispatch | Publishes a built VSIX (passed by `workflowRunId`) to VSCode Marketplace + OpenVSX |
| `cache-cleanup.yml` | PR closed + manual | Generic — usable as-is |
| `sync-main-with-releases.yml` | PR merged to a `*.*.x` line branch | Opens an auto-sync PR back to `main` |

## Versioning

The **root `package.json` `version` field is the single source of truth** for the
shipped version, and on `main` it always carries the *next* release as a snapshot:
`major.minor.patch-SNAPSHOT` (e.g. `5.14.0-SNAPSHOT`). `-SNAPSHOT` is never shipped —
every publishable build derives a concrete version from it, and `updateVersion` fails
the build if one reaches packaging with the suffix intact.

**Only `main` uses `-SNAPSHOT`.** Release lines (`5.14.x`) and staging branches (`alpha`)
carry a concrete version that is authored by hand, and builds from those ship it as-is.
See [Branches](#branches).

**Even minors are release lines; odd minors are the pre-release channel** — the VS Code
convention, and the reason for the arithmetic below. `main`'s snapshot therefore always
names an even minor.

**It is the only version anyone edits.** Two files carry a **generated** copy of it, both written by
`common/scripts/sync-version.js`, which each project chains at the head of its own `build`
script so the value is refreshed before anything reads it:

| Generated file | Consumed by |
|---|---|
| `packages/ballerina-extension/package.json` (`version`) | `vsce`, which packages it off disk as it always has — that manifest ships inside the VSIX as `extension/package.json` |
| `packages/ballerina-language-server/gradle.properties` (`version=`) | Gradle, via the ordinary `allprojects { version = project.version }` — no version logic in `build.gradle` |

`-Pversion=<v>` overrides the Gradle side for a one-off build, by normal Gradle precedence
(a command-line property beats `gradle.properties`). That is how `ls-publish-release.yml`
and the daily-build LS matrix pin a version, and it needs no code in `build.gradle`.

Because the sync runs at the *start* of every build, **editing either generated file by hand
has no effect** — the next build overwrites it. That is deliberate: a stale or hand-edited
copy reaching an artifact is exactly the failure this design removes.

The guarantee is scoped to builds that go through rush/pnpm. A bare `./gradlew pack`
invoked directly uses whatever `gradle.properties` currently holds, since nothing has run
the sync — so build the LS with `rush build --to ballerina-language-server` (or run
`node common/scripts/sync-version.js` first) when the root version has moved.

Packaging itself goes through the shared
`submodules/.../common-libs/scripts/package-vsix.js`, unchanged. The extension's `postbuild`
does add one step before it, `clearVsix`, which deletes previously built VSIXes from the
package root and `vsix/`. Without it they accumulate: `vsce` only overwrites a file of the
*same* name, and `copyVSIX` (`copyfiles *.vsix ./vsix`) then copies every root VSIX forward,
so one file per version ever built piles up in both places. That is not cosmetic — e2e
resolves the VSIX to install by newest mtime across those folders
(`e2e-test/.../utils/helpers/setup.ts`), and a set copied in one pass shares a timestamp, so
the winner is undefined and a run can install a months-old build.

Its glob is `ballerina-[0-9]*.vsix`, requiring a digit after the dash so it can never match
`ballerina-integrator-*.vsix` — which really can sit in `vsix/`, because the e2e prerelease
path downloads it there (`test.list.ts`). `setup.ts` makes the same exclusion.

`.github/actions/updateVersion` is the only place the version is mutated, and the root
`package.json` is the only file it touches. It applies an optional explicit override, then
derives the version for the build type.

The derivation depends on the *shape* of the root version, not on the branch:

| Build | Root version | Result | Example | `vsce --pre-release` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PR / local | either | untouched | `5.14.0-SNAPSHOT` (never packaged) | no |
| Nightly | `-SNAPSHOT` | `major.(minor-1).<yymmddHHmm>` | `5.13.2607290130` | yes |
| Pre-release (`isPreRelease: true`) | `-SNAPSHOT` | `major.(minor-1).<yymmddHHmm>` | `5.13.2607290145` | yes |
| Pre-release | concrete | as authored | `5.13.2607290145` | yes |
| Release | `-SNAPSHOT` | minus `-SNAPSHOT` | `5.14.0` | no |
| Release | concrete | as authored | `5.14.1` | no |

Nightlies and snapshot-based pre-releases share one derivation
(`common/scripts/nightly-version.js`), which **decrements the minor** — landing on an odd
one, the pre-release channel — so the version sorts above every real release of the
previous line (`5.13.4` < `5.13.2607290130`) and below the release `main` is heading for
(`5.13.2607290130` < `5.14.0`). Publishing either as `5.14.x` would make it outrank the
eventual `5.14.0` and VS Code would never update off it. The timestamp is
minute-granular so a nightly and a pre-release cut on the same day cannot collide, and it
goes in the *patch* position because VS Code extension versions must be three integers —
`5.14.0-alpha.1` is not available.

The script hard-fails on a root version that is not `major.minor.patch-SNAPSHOT`, and on a
minor of `0` (there is no `minor - 1` to publish under; a new major line needs a human
decision). `updateVersion` therefore only calls it when the root actually carries
`-SNAPSHOT`; on a release line or staging branch the authored version is published as-is.
**Consequence:** those branches must be bumped by hand between releases, or the second run
reuses a version that both the Marketplace and the git tag reject.

After a release cut from `main`, `.github/actions/pr` opens a PR returning `main` to
`major.(minor+2).0-SNAPSHOT` — `+2`, because `+1` would land on an odd minor, i.e. the
pre-release line, and the next nightly would then derive `5.14.<ts>` and collide with the
`5.14.x` line just released. It fires only when `main` is sitting on the very snapshot the
release consumed, so a patch cut from a line branch leaves `main` alone. Leaving `main` on
a concrete version is not cosmetic: the next nightly fails, because that derivation
requires a snapshot.

A note on `npm version`: the version is always written through it and **read back** from
`package.json` rather than reusing a composed string, because npm normalizes on write
(notably stripping a leading zero that an appended timestamp can produce, which is not
strict semver).

`isPreRelease` does more than pick a version: it is exported into the rush build env, where
`common-libs/scripts/package-vsix.js` turns it into `vsce package --pre-release`. A nightly
passes `isPreRelease: true` for exactly that reason — a nightly *is* a pre-release, its
derived version already sits on the odd-minor pre-release channel, and the two paths should
differ only in how they are branched and tagged, never in how they are packaged. It does not
affect the nightly's version, which is already committed on the `nightly` branch:
`updateVersion` is gated on the `ballerina` input, which the daily build passes as `false`.

## Branches

| Branch | Root version | Created by |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | `X.Y.0-SNAPSHOT`, **Y even** | — |
| `nightly` | `X.(Y-1).<yymmddHHmm>` | the daily build, force-pushed every run |
| `X.Y.x` — `5.14.x`, `5.16.x` | concrete, never `-SNAPSHOT` | **by hand**, when a line opens |
| `alpha` | concrete, set by hand | **by hand** |
| `release/X.Y.Z` | inherited from the branch it was cut from | `release-vsix.yml`, non-pre-release only |

A release dispatched with `isPreRelease: false` commits the packaged version, pushes
`release/<version>` (reusing it if it already exists), and opens a PR from it into `X.Y.x`.
The commit matters: `updateVersion` writes the version into the *working tree* during the
build, so without it the released version would exist in no commit anywhere — and the
`v<version>` tag is pinned to that commit, not to the dispatched one, so the tagged tree
carries the version it is named after. **The line branch is never created
automatically** — deciding when to open a line is a human call — so if it does not exist the
PR is skipped with a notice naming the branch to cut, rather than failing a release that has
already been published. Merging that PR triggers `sync-main-with-releases.yml`, which opens
the PR carrying the line's fixes back to `main`.

Releases from `main` are the only ones that bump anything: see the `+2` rule above.

Nothing here targets `stable/ballerina`. That branch came from `wso2/vscode-extensions`,
where one repo held several extensions and each needed its own stable trunk
(`stable/ballerina`, `stable/mi`, `stable/choreo`, …). Here `main` is that trunk.

## The nightly branch

`daily-build.yml` builds from a `nightly` branch that it maintains itself: every run
resets it to `origin/main`, commits the timestamped version, and force-pushes. So
`git diff main nightly` is always exactly the version bump, and every nightly VSIX has
one commit that pins both its source and its version.

- **Never open a PR against `nightly` and never merge it anywhere** — it is discarded
  and recreated daily.
- The extension build is pinned to the nightly *commit SHA*, not the branch name, so a
  concurrent run cannot swap the tree mid-build. The build does not re-stamp the
  version; the commit is authoritative (re-deriving the timestamp would produce a
  different version as soon as the clock ticked past the minute).
- The version commit carries the root `package.json` plus both generated files, so the
  nightly commit is internally consistent and the jar built from it carries the nightly
  version.
- The force-push uses `GITHUB_TOKEN`, whose pushes do not trigger workflows, so the
  daily build cannot re-enter itself.

Every GitHub release carries two assets — the VSIX and the bundled LS jar — so the server
can be downloaded on its own to debug a regression, or pointed at an existing install via
`ballerina.langServerPath`. It is the exact jar inside the VSIX, packed at the same version,
so the two can never disagree about what was built. On the rolling `nightly` release they are
replaced in place (upload-then-rename, old asset deleted only after the new one is verified)
so the download URLs keep working even if a run fails.

**A pre-release does not get a GitHub release unless asked.** `release-vsix.yml` takes a
`githubRelease` input, off by default, and a real release ignores it:

| Dispatch | GitHub release + tag | Version commit + `release/X.Y.Z` |
|---|---|---|
| Release (`isPreRelease: false`) | always | yes |
| Pre-release, `githubRelease: false` (default) | no | no |
| Pre-release, `githubRelease: true` | yes, on the dispatched commit | no |

A real release is never gated because its version commit, branch and tag all come out of that
one step. Skipping the release does **not** block marketplace publishing: `publish-vsix.yml`
takes the `VSIX` workflow artifact by run ID (30-day retention), not by release tag. What is
lost is the standalone LS jar download, since the artifact holds only the VSIX — dispatch with
`githubRelease: true` when the jar is wanted.

The release's **pre-release label follows `isPreRelease`** (`actions/release`'s `prerelease`
input, default `true`, which is what the nightly relies on). It used to be hardcoded `true` for
everything, with `publish-vsix.yml` demoting a real release to a proper release once the
marketplace served it. That staged promotion had a failure mode with no signal: cut a release
and skip publishing, and it stayed labelled a pre-release forever. `publish-vsix.yml` still
patches the label, which is now a harmless no-op for releases cut after this change.

## The bundled language server

The jar in `packages/ballerina-extension/ls/` is **always** the `pack` output of
`packages/ballerina-language-server` in this repo, copied by `scripts/copy-ls.js` during
`postbuild`. There is no download fallback and no way to select a different LS: a
prebuilt jar from elsewhere could not carry this repo's version, so a VSIX built around
one would ship an extension and a server claiming different versions.

Consequence: building the extension requires being able to build the LS — JDK 21 and
GitHub Packages credentials (`packageUser` / `packagePAT`). If the jar is missing,
`copy-ls.js` fails with instructions rather than silently substituting one.

`ls-publish-release.yml` publishes `io.ballerina:ballerina-language-server` at the same
parent version. It does not run Gradle's `release` task: that task rewrote the `version=`
key in `gradle.properties`, which no longer exists now that the root `package.json` owns
the version.

## Required GitHub secrets

- `BALLERINA_BOT_USERNAME` / `BALLERINA_BOT_EMAIL` / `BALLERINA_BOT_TOKEN` — LS publish workflow (git identity + write to `ballerina-platform` packages + releases)
- `BALLERINA_CENTRAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` — LS publish to Ballerina Central
- `VSCE_TOKEN` — publish-vsix → VSCode Marketplace
- `OPENVSX_TOKEN` — publish-vsix → OpenVSX
- `EDITOR_TEAM_CHAT_API` — every chat notification: threaded release progress, the release
  announcement, daily build success, and build/sync failures
- `CLOUD_EDITOR_BUILDER_REPO` / `CLOUD_EDITOR_BUILDER_REPO_TOKEN` — optional cross-repo dispatch on stable release (publish-vsix)
- `COPILOT_ROOT_URL` / `COPILOT_DEV_ROOT_URL` / `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY` — passed through to the build composite action

Configure these in the new repo's settings before triggering anything.

All chat notifications share one secret, so a chat webhook is configured in exactly one place.
Before this, the daily build used a separate `BI_TEAM_CHAT_API` that was never configured on the
repo, which is what failed run `30416319364`: an unset secret hands `curl` a URL that is only a
query string, so it exits 3 with `URL rejected: Malformed input to a URL function` and fails the
job *after* the build, release and asset uploads have all succeeded.

The release notifications (`actions/release`, `actions/pr`, and the inline steps in
`release-vsix.yml`) skip with a notice when the secret is empty, so a fork can run a release
without a webhook. `dailyBuildNotification` and `failure-notification` do **not** — they still
fail the job on an empty value, which is only safe as long as `EDITOR_TEAM_CHAT_API` stays
configured.

## Composite actions under `.github/actions/`

| Action | Used by |
|---|---|
| `build` | `build.yml` — runs rush install + `rush build --to ballerina` |
| `updateVersion` | `build`, `daily-build.yml` — resolves the version from the root `package.json` and propagates it |
| `release` | `release-vsix.yml` — owns everything that materialises a release: the version commit, `release/<version>`, the tag, the GitHub release and its assets; `daily-build.yml` — rolling `nightly` release with the VSIX + LS jar (no commit, no branch) |
| `pr` | `release-vsix.yml` — opens the follow-up pull requests (release PR into `X.Y.x`, next-snapshot PR into `main`) + Google Chat notification |
| `dailyBuildNotification` | `daily-build.yml` — success chat notification |
| `failure-notification` | `daily-build.yml`, `release-vsix.yml` — failure chat notification |
