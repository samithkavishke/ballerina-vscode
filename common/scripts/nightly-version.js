/**
 * Derives the nightly version from the root package.json and prints it.
 *
 * main always carries the *next* release as a snapshot — 'major.minor.patch-SNAPSHOT'
 * (e.g. 5.14.0-SNAPSHOT). A nightly is unreleased work heading toward that version,
 * so it is published as:
 *
 *     major.(minor - 1).<minutes since 2020-01-01 UTC>    5.14.0-SNAPSHOT -> 5.13.3458370
 *
 * The minor is decremented so a nightly sorts *above* every real release of the
 * previous line (5.13.4 < 5.13.3458370) and *below* the release main is heading
 * for (5.13.3458370 < 5.14.0). Publishing it as 5.14.x instead would make the
 * nightly outrank the eventual 5.14.0 release, and VS Code would never update off
 * it. The timestamp lands in the patch position rather than being appended so the
 * result is a plain three-part version, with no leading-zero semver trap.
 *
 * WHY MINUTES-SINCE-EPOCH AND NOT A READABLE 'yymmddHHmm':
 * VS Code Marketplace version components are int32, max 2147483647. A yymmddHHmm
 * stamp is 2607291530 for this very date — over the limit — and every value the
 * scheme can produce from 2022 onward exceeds it, so 'vsce publish' would reject
 * every pre-release. Minutes since 2020-01-01 is 7 digits (~3.4M), three orders of
 * magnitude clear of the limit, still monotonic and still minute-granular. It stays
 * under int32 until the year 6099, which is long enough.
 *
 * Decode one with:
 *     node -e 'console.log(new Date(Date.UTC(2020,0,1) + <stamp>*60000).toISOString())'
 *
 * Pre-releases use this same derivation. The stamp is minute-granular, so a nightly
 * and a pre-release collide only if they are cut within the same minute.
 *
 * Usage: node common/scripts/nightly-version.js [--timestamp <minutes>]
 *
 * Exit codes:
 * - 0: version printed on stdout
 * - 1: the root version is not a 'major.minor.patch-SNAPSHOT' with a decrementable minor,
 *      or the stamp is not a positive integer below int32
